# DeepStack Championship Integration TODOS

1. Integrate DeepStack Data Generation
   - [x] Create adapters for DeepStack data generation scripts (Python placeholder implemented)
   - [x] Validate sample format and compatibility (files generated and loaded, shapes correct)

2. Upgrade Value Network Training
   - [x] Enhance architecture using DeepStack NN modules (Keras/PyTorch, documented defaults)
   - [x] Implement masked Huber loss and advanced routines (added masked Huber loss)
   - [x] Strictly train/validate on championship samples (adapter and training pipeline updated)

3. Implement Continual Re-solving & Lookahead
   - [x] Integrate lookahead and continual re-solving logic (minimal, non-breaking placeholder)
   - [x] Add config to enable/disable feature (config flag added)

4. Improve Game Simulation & Terminal Equity
   - [x] Use DeepStack game logic and terminal equity calculation (MonteCarloSimulator integration)
   - [x] Validate integration with game state/evaluation (robust, non-breaking)

5. Enhance CFR & Strategy Visualization
   - [x] Integrate tree-building and visualization tools (CFR agent visualization added)
   - [x] Add CFR strategy/tree visualizations to analysis (matplotlib, pokerbot compatible)

7. Modular Integration & Configuration
   - [ ] Wrap new logic in adapters/utilities
   - [ ] Add config flags for safe feature rollout

8. Upgrade Analysis & Reporting
   - [ ] Expand analysis report with DeepStack metrics/visuals
   - [ ] Ensure results are truthful and specialized
