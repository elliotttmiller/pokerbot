## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Run Automated Tests
```bash
cd /path/to/pokerbot
python scripts/test_training_pipeline.py
```
**Expected:** All 6 tests pass [OK]

### Step 2: Run Smoketest Training
```bash
python scripts/train_champion.py --mode smoketest
```
**Expected:** Completes in 5-7 minutes, creates trained model

### Step 3: Validate Training
```bash
python scripts/validate_training.py --model models/champion_final --hands 100
```
**Expected:** 80%+ tests pass, GOOD or EXCELLENT status

### Step 4: Test Trained Agent
```python
from src.agents import ChampionAgent

agent = ChampionAgent(name="Trained", use_pretrained=False)
agent.load_strategy("models/champion_final")

# Use agent for poker decisions
action, raise_amt = agent.choose_action(...)
```

## Expected Performance

### Smoketest Mode (5-7 minutes)
- **vs Random agents:** 70-80% win rate
- **vs Fixed agents:** 55-65% win rate
- **vs CFR agents:** 45-55% win rate
- **Consistency:** 80-100%
- **Memory:** 100-300 experiences
- **CFR:** 40-60 information sets

### Full Training Mode (2-3 hours)
- **vs Random agents:** 75-85% win rate
- **vs Fixed agents:** 65-75% win rate
- **vs CFR agents:** 50-60% win rate
- **Consistency:** 85-95%
- **Memory:** 1000+ experiences
- **CFR:** 200+ information sets

## Key Features Implemented

### Progressive Training
1. **Stage 1: CFR Warmup**
   - Builds game-theoretic foundation
   - Pure CFR self-play iterations
   - Creates information set strategies

2. **Stage 2: Self-Play**
   - Agent plays against itself
   - DQN training through experience replay
   - Iterative improvement

3. **Stage 3: Vicarious Learning**
   - Learns from diverse opponents:
     - Random agents
     - Fixed strategy agents
     - CFR agents
     - DQN agents
   - Adapts to different play styles
   - Builds robust strategy

### Robust Implementation
- ✅ Automatic checkpointing every N episodes
- ✅ Progress monitoring and logging
- ✅ Detailed metrics (win rate, rewards, epsilon, memory)
- ✅ Training reports with statistics
- ✅ Resume from checkpoint capability
- ✅ Error handling for edge cases
- ✅ Two training modes (smoketest/full)

### Comprehensive Validation
- ✅ Agent state validation
- ✅ Performance benchmarking
- ✅ Consistency testing
- ✅ Learning indicators
- ✅ Automated test suite

## Technical Details

### Training Configuration
```python
class TrainingConfig:
    # Smoketest mode
    stage1_cfr_iterations = 100
    stage2_selfplay_episodes = 50
    stage3_vicarious_episodes = 50
    
    # Full mode
    stage1_cfr_iterations = 5000
    stage2_selfplay_episodes = 2000
    stage3_vicarious_episodes = 3000
```

### Agent Architecture
```python
ChampionAgent:
  ├── CFR Component (game-theoretic)
  ├── DQN Component (neural network)
  ├── Equity Calculator (preflop tables)
  └── Ensemble Decision Making
```

### Saved Files
```
models/champion_final.cfr         # CFR strategy
models/champion_final.keras       # DQN model
models/champion_final_metadata.json  # Training stats
```
