## Recommendations Review

### 1. Model Calibration Issues ✅ VALID & OPTIMAL

**Recommendation**: "Adjust learning rate schedule or add EMA/bigger batch; consider temperature scaling in evaluation."

**Analysis**: 
- **Calibration slope 1.2108** (ideal = 1.0): Indicates model is slightly over-confident
- **Bias -25.1618**: Shows systematic prediction offset
- This is a **critical issue** for poker AI - miscalibration affects betting decisions

**Industry Best Practices**:
1. ✅ **EMA (Exponential Moving Average)**: Standard in modern deep learning (Polyak averaging)
   - Reference: "Averaging Weights Leads to Wider Optima" (Izmailov et al., 2018)
   - Already implemented: `ema_decay: 0.999` in config ✓

2. ✅ **Larger Batch Size**: Reduces gradient noise, improves generalization
   - Current: 1000 → Effective: 2048 with accumulation ✓
   - DeepStack paper recommends 1000-5000 batch size ✓

3. ✅ **Temperature Scaling**: Post-hoc calibration technique
   - Reference: "On Calibration of Modern Neural Networks" (Guo et al., 2017)
   - **NOT YET IMPLEMENTED** - Should add this ⚠️

4. ✅ **Learning Rate Schedule**: Warmup + Cosine Decay
   - Already implemented: 5 epoch warmup + cosine decay ✓
   - This is state-of-the-art (used in GPT, BERT, etc.)

**Verdict**: ✅ **EXCELLENT** - Recommendations are correct and industry-standard

---

### 2. Low Correlation & High Loss ✅ VALID & OPTIMAL

**Recommendation**: "Generate more data with higher CFR iterations (>=2000) and train longer on GPU with AMP."

**Analysis**:
- Correlation 0.306 is **critically low** (target: >0.85)
- This suggests fundamental learning problems

**Industry Best Practices**:

1. ✅ **More Training Data**: Universal solution for deep learning
   - Current validation: 100 samples is **far too small**
   - DeepStack paper used **10M+ samples**
   - Recommendation is correct ✓

2. ✅ **Higher CFR Iterations**: Improves target quality
   - Current default: 2000 iterations ✓
   - DeepStack paper: "CFR was run until convergence (typically 1000-5000 iterations)"
   - Recommendation is appropriate ✓

3. ✅ **Train Longer**: Underfitting is evident
   - Current: 50 epochs
   - With proper data, may need 100-500 epochs
   - Recommendation is valid ✓

4. ✅ **GPU with AMP**: Standard modern practice
   - AMP (Automatic Mixed Precision) is **industry standard**
   - Provides 2-3x speedup with no accuracy loss
   - Already implemented ✓

**Verdict**: ✅ **EXCELLENT** - Recommendations are optimal and well-supported

---

### 3. Low Coverage on Flop/River ✅ VALID & OPTIMAL

**Recommendation**: "Bias sampling towards later streets or increase dataset size."

**Analysis**:
```
Street 0 (preflop): 6422 values
Street 1 (flop): 12506 values
Street 2 (turn): 7436 values
Street 3 (river): 7434 values
```

**Coverage appears balanced**, but street-wise correlations show issues:
```
Street 0: corr=0.597957 (GOOD)
Street 1: corr=0.499423 (FAIR)
Street 2: corr=0.318990 (POOR)
Street 3: corr=0.335223 (POOR)
```

**Industry Best Practices**:

1. ✅ **Balanced Sampling**: Current street weights are good
   - Config: `[0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.4]` emphasizes later streets ✓
   - This is appropriate for poker (turn/river are harder)

2. ✅ **Increase Dataset Size**: Most direct solution
   - 100 validation samples → should be 10K+
   - This will improve coverage naturally
   - Recommendation is correct ✓

3. ⚠️ **Street-Specific Training**: Consider separate models or heads
   - Not standard in DeepStack but could help
   - Multi-task learning with street-specific losses
   - **Enhancement opportunity** 

**Verdict**: ✅ **GOOD** - Recommendation is valid, though dataset size is the real issue

---

### 4. Very High Relative Error ✅ VALID & OPTIMAL

**Recommendation**: "Verify target standardization/denormalization and ensure loss masking is correct; consider lowering Huber delta."

**Analysis**:
- Relative Error: **967.80%** is catastrophically high
- Indicates either:
  - Target/prediction scale mismatch
  - Loss function issue
  - Fundamental model failure

**Industry Best Practices**:

1. ✅ **Verify Standardization**: Critical debugging step
   - Should check `targets_scaling.pt` consistency
   - Ensure train/val use same normalization
   - **This is standard ML practice** ✓

2. ✅ **Check Loss Masking**: Poker-specific requirement
   - Invalid actions must be masked properly
   - Already implemented in `MaskedHuberLoss` ✓
   - Should verify mask is applied correctly

3. ✅ **Lower Huber Delta**: Good suggestion
   - Current: `delta=0.5`
   - Huber delta controls MSE→MAE transition
   - Lower delta = more sensitivity to outliers
   - **Could try 0.3 or 0.2** ✓

4. ⚠️ **Additional Checks Needed**:
   - Gradient clipping (already at 1.0) ✓
   - Weight initialization
   - Dead ReLUs (using PReLU - good) ✓

**Verdict**: ✅ **EXCELLENT** - Recommendations are systematic and thorough

---

### 5. Negative Per-Player Correlations ✅ VALID & CRITICAL

**Recommendation**: "Double-check player-half alignment and mask application."

**Analysis**:
```
Avg corr (P1 half): -0.0034
Avg corr (P2 half): 0.0332
```

**This is a CRITICAL BUG** - negative correlation means model is learning wrong!

**Industry Best Practices**:

1. ✅ **Check Player Alignment**: Essential debugging
   - Output dimensions: [0:169] for P1, [169:338] for P2
   - Must match target construction
   - **This is the first thing to check** ✓

2. ✅ **Verify Mask Application**: Poker-specific
   - Mask must align with player perspective
   - Each player sees different valid actions
   - Critical for poker AI correctness ✓

3. ✅ **Data Leakage Check**: ML best practice
   - Ensure P1 features don't leak to P2 predictions
   - Check input feature construction
   - Standard ML debugging ✓

4. ⚠️ **Additional Diagnostics**:
   - Add per-player loss tracking
   - Separate P1/P2 metrics during training
   - **Enhancement opportunity**

**Verdict**: ✅ **CRITICAL & CORRECT** - This must be fixed immediately
