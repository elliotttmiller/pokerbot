# Pluribus Poker AI Analysis & Recommendations

## Executive Summary

After comprehensive analysis of the [pluribus-poker-AI](https://github.com/keithlee96/pluribus-poker-AI) repository, I've identified key areas where our Champion Agent implementation can be significantly enhanced to create a more progressive and vicarious training pipeline.

## Key Findings from Pluribus Codebase

### 1. **Advanced CFR Implementation**

The Pluribus implementation uses sophisticated CFR variants:

- **CFR with Pruning (CFRp)**: Prunes actions with regret below threshold `-c`, reducing search space
- **Linear CFR (LCFR)**: Applies discounting to older regrets for faster convergence
- **Progressive Training**: Gradual transition between CFR → CFRp → LCFR based on iteration thresholds

**Current State in Our Codebase:**
- ✅ Basic vanilla CFR implemented
- ❌ No pruning mechanism
- ❌ No linear discounting
- ❌ No progressive strategy updates

### 2. **Information Set Abstraction & Clustering**

Pluribus uses **card abstraction** to reduce 56+ billion information sets to tractable sizes:

```python
# Pluribus approach
card_info_lut = {}  # Lookup table for card abstractions
state = new_game(n_players, card_info_lut, lut_path=lut_path)
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduces memory requirements by 1000x+
- Groups strategically similar situations
- Uses clustering algorithms for compression

**Current State in Our Codebase:**
- ❌ No card abstraction
- ❌ No information set clustering
- ❌ Direct string-based infoset keys (memory inefficient)

### 3. **Vicarious/Progressive Training Pipeline**

The Pluribus training is **progressive** with multiple phases:

```python
# Phase 1: Warm-up (iterations 1-prune_threshold)
#   - Pure CFR, build baseline strategy
#   - No pruning, explore full game tree

# Phase 2: Pruning begins (iterations prune_threshold-lcfr_threshold)
#   - 95% CFRp (pruned), 5% full CFR (exploration)
#   - Maintains exploration while speeding up

# Phase 3: Linear CFR (iterations > lcfr_threshold)
#   - Apply discounting every discount_interval iterations
#   - Recent iterations weighted more heavily
#   - d = t/discount_interval / (t/discount_interval + 1)

# Phase 4: Strategy updates (iterations > update_threshold)
#   - Only update strategy every strategy_interval iterations
#   - Allows for more stable convergence
```

**Current State in Our Codebase:**
- ❌ Single-phase training only
- ❌ No progressive curriculum
- ❌ No adaptive learning schedule

### 4. **Multiprocessing Architecture**

Pluribus uses **distributed training** with:
- Manager process for shared state
- Worker processes for parallel CFR iterations
- Thread-safe locks for concurrent access
- Efficient serialization/deserialization

**Current State in Our Codebase:**
- ❌ Single-threaded training only
- ❌ No distributed architecture

### 5. **Blueprint Strategy + Real-time Search**

Pluribus uses two-stage approach:
1. **Blueprint Strategy**: Pre-computed via CFR (offline)
2. **Real-time Search**: Depth-limited search during play (online)

**Current State in Our Codebase:**
- ✅ Pre-trained models loaded
- ❌ No real-time search during play

## Recommended Refactoring Plan

### Priority 1: Progressive CFR Training (HIGH IMPACT)

**What to Add:**
1. **CFR with Pruning (CFRp)**
   ```python
   # In champion_agent.py or new advanced_cfr.py
   def cfrp(agent, state, player_idx, p0, p1, c=-310000000):
       """CFR with pruning - skip actions with regret < c"""
       if state.is_terminal:
           return get_utility(state, player_idx)
       
       infoset = get_infoset(state)
       strategy = calculate_strategy(infoset.regret)
       
       # PRUNING: Skip actions with low regret
       pruned_actions = [a for a in actions 
                        if infoset.regret[a] > c]
       
       # Continue recursion only for viable actions
       ...
   ```

2. **Linear Discounting**
   ```python
   def apply_linear_cfr_discount(agent, t, discount_interval):
       """Discount older regrets/strategies"""
       d = (t / discount_interval) / ((t / discount_interval) + 1)
       for infoset in agent.infosets.values():
           for action in infoset.regret:
               infoset.regret[action] *= d
               infoset.strategy_sum[action] *= d
   ```

3. **Progressive Training Schedule**
   ```python
   class ProgressiveTrainer:
       def __init__(self, agent):
           self.phase_thresholds = {
               'warmup': 1000,        # Pure CFR
               'pruning': 10000,      # Start pruning
               'linear_cfr': 50000,   # Start discounting
           }
       
       def train_iteration(self, t):
           if t < self.phase_thresholds['warmup']:
               # Phase 1: Pure CFR exploration
               self.cfr(agent, state, player_idx, 1.0, 1.0)
           elif t < self.phase_thresholds['pruning']:
               # Phase 2: Mixed CFR/CFRp
               if random.random() < 0.05:
                   self.cfr(...)  # 5% full exploration
               else:
                   self.cfrp(...)  # 95% pruned
           else:
               # Phase 3: Full CFRp with discounting
               self.cfrp(...)
               if t % 1000 == 0:
                   self.apply_linear_cfr_discount(t, 1000)
   ```

           self.card_info_lut = {}
           if lut_path:
               self.load_lut(lut_path)
       
       def get_bucket(self, hole_cards, community_cards):
           """Map cards to abstraction bucket"""
           # Use hand strength percentile, 
           # potential for improvement, etc.
           hand_strength = calculate_hand_strength(...)
           return quantize_to_bucket(hand_strength)
   ```

2. **Clustered Information Sets**
   ```python

       # OLD: Direct string representation
       # return f"{hole_cards}|{community_cards}|{history}"
       
       # NEW: Use abstraction buckets
       bucket = self.card_abstraction.get_bucket(
           hole_cards, community_cards

        self.agent = agent
        self.n_workers = n_workers
        self.manager = Manager()
        
        # Shared state across processes
        self.shared_regret = self.manager.dict()
        self.shared_strategy = self.manager.dict()
    
    def train_parallel(self, n_iterations):
        with mp.Pool(self.n_workers) as pool:
            # Distribute iterations across workers
            results = pool.starmap(
                self.train_worker,
                [(i, n_iterations // self.n_workers) 
                 for i in range(self.n_workers)]
            )
```

            return self.blueprint.choose_action(...)
        
        # Use real-time search for critical decisions
        else:
            return self.depth_limited_search(
                state, self.search_depth
            )
```

## Vicarious Learning Aspects

The term "vicarious" in machine learning refers to learning from others' experiences. Here's how to make our training more vicarious:

### 1. **Multi-Agent Training**
```python
# Train against diverse opponents simultaneously
opponents = [
    RandomAgent(),
    FixedStrategyAgent(),
    CFRAgent(pretrained=True),
    DQNAgent(pretrained=True),
]

# Rotate opponents during training
for episode in range(n_episodes):
    opponent = random.choice(opponents)
    train_against(champion, opponent)
```

### 2. **Experience Replay from Pre-trained Models**
```python
# Load experiences from champion models
deepstack_experiences = load_experiences("pretrained/deepstack_games.pkl")
libratus_experiences = load_experiences("pretrained/libratus_games.pkl")

# Add to replay buffer
for experience in deepstack_experiences:
    champion.memory.append(experience)

# Learn from champion experiences
champion.replay(batch_size=64)
```

### 3. **Imitation Learning**
```python
# Learn to imitate champion strategies
def imitation_loss(champion_action, expert_action):
    return cross_entropy(champion_action, expert_action)

# Fine-tune on expert demonstrations
for state, expert_action in expert_dataset:
    champion_action = champion.choose_action(state)
    loss = imitation_loss(champion_action, expert_action)
    champion.update(loss)
```

## Conclusion

The Pluribus codebase demonstrates:
1. **Progressive training** is key to efficient convergence
2. **Card abstraction** is essential for scalability
3. **Multiprocessing** enables faster training
4. **Blueprint + Search** provides stronger play

Our Champion Agent has a solid foundation but needs these enhancements to reach truly championship-level performance with a modern, progressive training pipeline.

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Implement CFRp and progressive training schedule
2. **Short-term**: Add card abstraction system
3. **Medium-term**: Enable multiprocessing
4. **Long-term**: Integrate real-time search

Would you like me to start implementing any of these enhancements?
