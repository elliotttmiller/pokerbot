CFRDGadget: DeepStack-style CFR-D gadget for opponent range reconstruction during re-solving.

The CFRD (Counterfactual Regret Decomposition) Gadget is a key component of continual
re-solving. It reconstructs opponent ranges from their counterfactual values, enabling
consistent strategy computation across sequential game tree solves.

Based on DeepStack paper Section S2.3: "The CFR-D gadget solves an auxiliary game
to reconstruct the opponent's range that is consistent with their counterfactual values."

Implemented per paper specification for championship-level accuracy.
